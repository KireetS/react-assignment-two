-used mock json data made using a python script
-used a mock image
-didnt need to use redux , since project was fairly simple , if i did use redux , it would only have one hotels feature with getHotels reducer , so thats why did not do it
-show more button works as you want
-city selector works too
-i admit the ui is currently not that good , but since this is a assignment thats why i did this.
